## details
### Problem 1.
On the experience of 1.: What I have experienced, has never been changed since every first time I got back to CSS. First is the feeling that I make something quite ugly. Second is I could not align perfectly on the text. Third is the color I choose is bad.

The process was never been clear enough. Something like trying out the font, aligning stuff that are taking too much times.

The alignment has never been only about boxes. It's about how I align multiple texts, text with images, text, images and menu.

Search in cheatsheet CSS3 does not work, I guess it's not for basic

### Problem 2.
During css-ing, I sometimes adjusted HTML, which disrupt the css process, so that the experience could not stick in my head as a whole.

1. What is difficult with HTML?
Top down stuff is fine, but boundaries like <div>, <section> are very disruptive to egghead like me.

2. What is this so difficult about html boundaries?
considering the header making process: 
- I was making: header (then) img  (then) h1. Start styling about the background image, **how should I make size of the header?**, **how should I do the background?**
- I want to make it linear vertically, so I put it into 2 different divs.
... 
- Then I want to put it inline. Now I have to delete code from HTML and CSS in 2 different tabs... 
--- 
**Situation**: Image - Text
- Vertical-align: constraint from image to text
  + middle | top | bottom

**Situation**: Depends on each other: relatively via measurement.

## day 1
- Reason I picked the practice: I know the display: grid, it's for the layout, I know some of the naming convention, but I don't really know how to do it: 0 - 5 vocabularies. No basic model in my mind, to sketch out the basic site.

- Try to works on the header, and it's not very working, because:
  - I could not do the header part even, because I'm so lacking the vocab.
  - I so lacking of basic model.
  - I don't have a base, so that I could understand stuff.

## day 2

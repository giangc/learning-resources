 - from 2010: problems mentioned was about naming convnention, how to architect the css project. Those are common problems of 2010, which I assumed changed drammatically over 10 years. This should be for history of css lesson, but not right now :) 

http://www.cssworkflow.com/ : This is a page for an meeting in 2013, which have some interesting bullet points about whole css working process.

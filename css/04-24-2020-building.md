# BUILDING MODEL, date: 04-24-2020 

 While building stuff, keep a note containing information bellow

## plan: plan out what to build. 
* Build an image with big intro text and subtitle, 2 parts
  + [x] html: suitable tags
  + [x] text css: white, big, fonts, size for title 
  + [x] text: white, big, fonts, size for subtitle
  + [x] text position
  + [x] background
* cascading problem: anything that are dependent to each other, is making the fix of one become the fix of two
* margin does not work on <span> 

## questions/answer: questions on obstacle and how researching help overcome that obstacle 
* What is the html tag? for intro text and subtile
  + I use h2 and span id=substitle
* What do I do with text positioning?
  + Wrapper div, and align that div into middle
  + Align text. Cons, this could be hard to make 2 texts constraint

## mental model
* Layout Positioning model in css.
  + Defines position method: `position: static relative fixed absolute sticky`
  + Set appropriate properties: left right top bottom
  + This will aligned based on position method
  + relative | sticky | fixed: relative: enable  left right top bottom; sticky; fixed: fix with the viewport
* Text alignment:
  + left or right aligned, centered, or justified ~ left right center and stretch to fill width
* Conceptual model in text positioning:
  + Tools: container position, text alignment
* background tools:
  + position: positioning within the background container
  + background-clip: cliping area over boarder or inside boarder.
  + attachment: scroll or fixed on the screen
  + repeat: no repeat, repeat x
  + size: axis x and y, can be percentage

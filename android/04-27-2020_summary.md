## summary

* DI pattern
* Dagger: 
  + Create application graph based on @Component. 
  + Matching graph with dependencies using @Inject in both injector and injectee. Thus this generate a Factory type
  + @Scope like: @Singleton or @CustomScoped defines reusability of a dependency. A dependency can be singleton or can have multiple instances. 
  + reduce boillerplate code in implementing DI by generating code. 

> "When using activities, inject Dagger in the activity's onCreate() method before calling super.onCreate() to avoid issues with fragment restoration. During the restore phase in super.onCreate(), an activity attaches fragments that might want to access activity bindings."

> "When using fragments, inject Dagger in the fragment's onAttach() method. In this case, it can be done before or after calling super.onAttach()."
* Why Dagger? Centralizing dependencies management attempt in Android project particularly, or in java project in general.

## mental-model

#### How to create a Dagger component?
- Create a component as class and defines its dependencies via @Inject.
- Defines inject request: inject()

#### How to consume a Dagger component?
In inject requestor, inject: DaggerMyComponent.inject(this).create()

> "When using **activities**, inject Dagger in the activity's onCreate() method before calling super.onCreate() to avoid issues with fragment restoration. During the restore phase in super.onCreate(), an activity attaches fragments that might want to access activity bindings."

> "When using **fragments**, inject Dagger in the fragment's onAttach() method. In this case, it can be done before or after calling super.onAttach()."

#### 

#### Why subcomponent and steps to create it?

**Why subcomponent**
Component with its parent component. Because sometimes it needs to create a dependency from a class that is not owned by your project scope

**Steps to create it**
* Create a sub component with @Subcomponent. Defines @Subcomponent.Factory, which therefore will be consumed by parent @Component. Also defines inject requestor
* Create submodule class and declare modules = SubComponent.class
* Include the submodule as module. And expose it into parent component with @Provides.Factory. e.g `fun loginComponent(): LoginComponent.Factory ` 

#### @ActivityScope instead of @LoginScope

## cheatsheet

#### Describe @Inject annotator in Dagger. 

* @Inject annotator is used to connect injector and injectee. 

``` JAVA
  // kotlin
  // This's injector
  class Car @Inject constructor(val e: Engine, var wheel: Wheel) {
    // .. 
  }

  // Injectees
  class Engine @Inject constructor(){
    
  }
  class Wheel @Inject constructor(){

  }
  ```
#### Provide classes that your project doesn't own
``` JAVA
// kotlin
// @Module informs Dagger that this class is a Dagger Module
@Module
class NetworkModule {

    // @Provides tell Dagger how to create instances of the type that this function
    @Provides
    fun provideLoginRetrofitService(): LoginRetrofitService {
        return Retrofit.Builder()
                .baseUrl("https://example.com")
                .build()
                .create(LoginService::class.java)
    }
}

// The "modules" attribute in the @Component annotation tells Dagger what Modules
// to include when building the graph
@Component(modules = [NetworkModule::class])
interface ApplicationComponent {
    ...
}

```


#### Create a custom scope

``` JAVA
// kotlin
// Creates MyCustomScope
@Scope
@MustBeDocumented
@Retention(value = AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)
annotation class MyCustomScope
```

``` JAVA
// Kotlin
@MyCustomScope
@Component
interface ApplicationGraph {
    fun repository(): UserRepository
}

@MyCustomScope
class UserRepository @Inject constructor(
    private val localDataSource: UserLocalDataSource,
    private val service: UserService
) { ... }
```

#### Use @Singleton as scope

``` JAVA
// Kotlin
@Singleton
@Component
interface ApplicationGraph {
    fun repository(): UserRepository
}

@Singleton
class UserRepository @Inject constructor(
    private val localDataSource: UserLocalDataSource,
    private val service: UserService
) { ... }
```

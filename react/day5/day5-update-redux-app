update redux app on codepen.io. Encountering little intensive computing moment:
 - Easy to prone to doing chain dispatch inside a reducers(which seems like horrible)
 - Dispatching logic(whole business logic is in here):
   - Chain: One dispatch after another in order to achieve a goal.
   - Group: group and run several dispatches in order to achieve a goal.
 - Debugging dispatch is fairly hard it seems, if encountering some complex logic.

 * What is the most complex logic that I have encountered during working on any android app?
   - update to several places.
   - 

 * How does the native solve react app problems? 
   - Centralise data management
   - state dispatch
   - Isolate and identify logic with Reducer

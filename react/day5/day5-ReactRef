Use ReactRef to reference the DOM element. This is essentially needed when I need to manipulate DOM element, e.g: adjusting, styling after loading data.

1. Create a ReactRef with image
  - In constructor: this.imageRef = React.ReactRef()
  - In jsx: ref=${imageRef}

2. Update styling with ReactRef.
In a task of: Re-adjust size of image after is get loaded:
- add event load in the react ref, and callback function, in componentDidMount() method
  imageRef.addEventListener('load', setSpans)
  
  const setSpans = () => {/*compute code here.*/}

# Setup simple react app:
npm install -g create-react-app # Step 1 
create-react-app # Step 2

Day 1 Recap: Getting started, installing environment. Find a old course from udemy to view core simple explanation, which is quite effective. Get my head around the programming language. Couple of commands, take it slow on environment + libraries, etc.

Interactive Questions:

1. Explain the environment, including: dependencies, tools, important workflow, things that I must know in advance in order to catch up
- Explain debugging process
- Explain development process

Plugins:

Color Hightlight

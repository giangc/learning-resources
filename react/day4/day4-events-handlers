- onChange
- onSubmit
- onClick

onChange={onInputChange()} vs. onChange={onInputChange}
-> onInputChange is callback function not a function
 If the onInputChange is a function, then everytime render is called, onInputChange() is called because it's the function not a callback.

- Control and uncontrol
 Control event is props value that can be controlled inside the React scope
 Uncontrol event value is props value that cannot be known or change in React scope, it usually in DOM value.

event.preventDefault()

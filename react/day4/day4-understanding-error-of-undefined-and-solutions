.. Example:

... 

this.state = {term: "Term 1"}

<form onSubmit={onFormSubmit} .. </form>

onFormSubmit(event){
  console.log(this.state.term)
}

-> Error message: Cannot read property state of undefined.
Break down in a machine way 
"undefined" is javascript object
either "undefined" has not been created or "undefined".state has not been created.

Solving the problem: 
- use constructor() with bind()
- use arrow function

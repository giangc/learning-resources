## Aspects

1. How did I plan?

 * pretty close on how I was doing, in general. Some stuff that have never been touched: 

    - Glossary
    - Cheatsheet(actually I have some cheatsheet but I don't update here.)

2. How did I work?

* 60% loging thing on side note.40% write as comment on code(preferable style). This aspect I planned to be Q/A but turns out I was start them with PROBLEM1 -> <the-way-i-solve-it> <reference-url>

3. Outcome
* Some various techhnical quests come up
* Forgot the very fundamental model in React: state based UI render. But come back after few search.
* Follow plan pretty closely(90%): most of others are like thing to learn or big function needs to be implemented.
* mental-mdodel: some easy to become a problem get noticed.. This part raise some questions about how I do it.
* links: some links to find out I would use, 
  + for detailed docs
  + exaplained in html problem, when I was tryting to solve the css class toggle.

## Difficulties

Major problems are:

* css: toogle state
* refactoring with "undefined"

Some problems that I skipped.

## Revision

* QA turns into problems
* Skipping problems will turn out to be techincal debt, which needs a place to list all. E.g: **skipping problems**

## Reflection on tech

### React Way
* quite hard, not that easy, on the splitting thing.
* Reusing is a honey trap, that would takes lots of times.
* Type-safe, will save the later life.

### CSS way
* Build something from refernce(e.g: the design), would be much better with React way. If not, then the process is fairly messy, because the brain is dealing 2 difficult thing at the same time(this might be improved later).
* This definitely needs separate practice effort.

### JS
* Some algorithmic topics like, async await, arrays, needs serious practice.

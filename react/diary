## Plan
- [x] Extract to Image Card
- [x] Image Card: passing info using props
- [x] create a css file
- [x] apply css style into React
- [x] program css: display: grid to Image List

## Obstacles
- How do I use the css?
  * Naming convention with css: ImageList.css
  * put the className inside its container, not the ImageCard
  * Use `className="image-list"` instead of `className={className}` is wrong! : this is reference of js object.
# plan

* [x] run again and brainstorm what I'm going to build.
* [x] fix the display grid to display 3 cols(probably typo)
* create a menu where: list pictures, search picture
  +  sketch UI: 
  + [x] Break down component: Menu, Search, List
  + [x] menu -> search; menu -> list
  + [x] conditional rendering
  + [x] search
  + [x] list
  + [x] menu: semnatic ui menu
  + [x] onClick callback: update tab state
  + [x] reference of those tab: use ReactRef.
  + tab-state: update tab-state via Ref: React.createRef() receives the underlying DOM element as its current property?? This very questionable
  + [x] state based rendering
  [x] list pictures api

* [ ] add tabs display car, house and flowers
* [ ] save for favorite pictures
* [ ] Enhance UI: display a big picture and white title in the middle
* [ ] learn about the css unit, anything more flexible?

# QA

1. how to display in 3 cols?
* auto-fill let the browser decide howmany col displayed.??
2. grid-template-columns does not work?
* worked: grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr)); 
3. Conditional rendering? done
4. how do I create links?
* onClick callback: update tab state
* tab-state:
* reference of those tab: use ReactRef.
5. How to take optional param in axios?

6. default value in js?
7. I only remember componentDidMount?, because it's like the the onCreate, what the other

# mental model

1. Remember React is state based render system. Every rendering needs to go thru state!
  + get the response by call api, await for it
  + update the state.
  + map state to render.
2. List based requires to have key defined on the direct child defined on the list item. Not on the Child component
3. Refactoring problem, when puting data directly inside the Component:
  + Moving to other class cause: "undefined" due to null
4. Resuing problem: could be quite painful if, the data image are misaligned between function Search and function List.
5. Avoid loading data inside render(), it's quite hard to remember for the first time building.
